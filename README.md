## Your Task

Your task is to create a simple application using Django. We estimate this will take 2-3 hours for a person who is familiar with the technology stack. However, expect extra 3-4 hours if you are not familiar with Django or React. The technology stack is the same that you will be using in when working us.

#### Functional requirements
* Create account
* Login
* Logout
* Change email or password
* Delete account

## Back-end
You should develop the back-end using Django. APIs can be served through Django Rest Framework, feel free to choose what you think it's better. Your Django App should be able to receive requests to support all the requirements.

It's important to you follow the REST principles, respecting HTTP protocol and using properly return codes and HTTP methods.  Also, all communications should be done using JSON.


## Front-end
You should develop the frond-end using React or Django Templates. This application must consume the API you created using Django

#### Sign-up / Sign-in screen
The first screen is a "signup modal" type of screen. The user should be able to create an account and login using an email and password. [Reference Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) [Reference Dribble](https://dribbble.com/session/new)

#### User info screen
This page should display the user email and password (with \*). Also, users should have the ability to change the email or password and delete their account. This screen can't be visible for non logged-in users. 

## Optional tasks
* Validate user input on the browser and on the server
* Use uuid instead pk for user identification
* Add end-to-end tests
* Apply CSRF Protection
* Implement Security patterns

## How your exercise submission will be ranked

We will look:

* If the task was correctly completed
* Clean code
* Visual quality of the user interface changes - the layouts must look professional, not broken
* Unit Testing and Integration Testing
* Documentation (README and code comments)

## Delivery

Please upload your code to a repository we can access and let us know when it's ready. If possible, deploy the code onto some remote server so it's working too.

Don't worry about getting everything pixel perfect, the goal is to make sure you can handle tools and build custom interfaces, navigation, state management and have the general engineering knowledge to solve the problems at hand.
